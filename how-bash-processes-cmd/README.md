### Bash Command Line Interpretation Steps

- Tokenisation;

**token** is a sequence of characters that is considered as a "single unit" by the shell <br>
Shell looks for "Metacharacters" in order to understand where token starts ends <br>
Metacharacters -> ```| & ; ( ) < > space tab newline``` <br>

**word** is a token that does NOT contain an "unquoted" metacharacter
